          About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
         I approach software as an end-to-end system rather than isolated features. My focus is on building applications that are stable, scalable, and maintainable under real-world usage conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I value clear architecture, automation, and ownership. If something
          breaks in production, I treat it as my responsibility to understand
          and fix it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continuously refine my skills by building, shipping, and operating
          systems end to end.
